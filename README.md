# 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

This is a group project for the "0x1D. C - Binary Trees" topic in the ALX Software Engineering Program curriculum. The project focuses on algorithms and data structures related to binary trees. The project is to be completed by a team of two people, consisting of:

- Mohamed KADI
- Fatimazahra Elalaoui

## Project Timeline

- **Start Date**: October 30, 2023, 4:00 AM
- **End Date**: November 3, 2023, 4:00 AM
- **Checker Release Date**: October 31, 2023, 4:00 AM
- **Auto Review Deadline**: End of the project

## Resources

Before starting this project, make sure to read and watch the following resources:

- [Binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) (Note: Not to be confused with B-tree.)
- [Data Structure and Algorithms - Tree](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/tree_data_structure.htm)
- [Tree Traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal)
- [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)
- [Data structures: Binary Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/)
  
## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

**General**
- What is a binary tree?
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree?
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists?
- What are the depth, the height, and the size of a binary tree?
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree?
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree?

**Copyright - Plagiarism**

You are required to come up with solutions for the tasks yourself to meet the above learning objectives. Copying and pasting someone else's work is strictly forbidden, and any form of plagiarism will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

**General**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the standard library
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `binary_trees.h`
- Don't forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

**GitHub**
- There should be one project repository per group. Cloning, forking, or duplicating a project repository with the same name before the second deadline risks a 0% score.

## More Info

**Data Structures**

Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees, and include them in your `binary_trees.h` header file:

**Basic Binary Tree**
```c
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```

**Binary Search Tree**
```c
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
```

**AVL Tree**
```c
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
```

**Max Binary Heap**
```c
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
```

**Print Function**

To match the examples in the tasks, you are provided with a print function. This function is used solely for visualization purposes and does not need to be pushed to your repository. It may not be used during the correction.

**Project Tasks**

The specific tasks for this project are provided separately.

Good luck with your project! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the project leads or your peers for assistance.
